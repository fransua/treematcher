Kind of regular expression to search for specific tree patterns, both
topological and branch distances.

pattern could be a newick structure, whose name is parsed as a series
of conditions. 
((sp=Hsa,sp=Pta,name=Hsa001),dups>1, name, H in species, )[dist>0.1*starter]

class TreeMatcher(Object):
      root = starter
      n_childs:
      n_seqs_
      in
      not in
      number of dups
      proportional dists
      ... capacity to extend ...
 

Matcher could be a recursive function.

use proportion among branch lenghts. 

how to auto generate pattern from real trees?
